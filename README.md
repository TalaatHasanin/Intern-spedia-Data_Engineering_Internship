## Internship outlines:
I was selected for a data engineering internship, and this helped me a lot in developing my skills.
In this internship, I learned how to build a Data Warehouse, build an entire ETL system, and develop a continuous data pipeline system that helps transfer data from a source on the local machine or AWS S3 Bucket as a cloud provider to Snowflake Cloud Warehouses.
